    <p>Permutation matrices play a crucial role in linear algebra, particularly in the context of matrix operations. 
      A permutation matrix is a square binary matrix that represents a specific rearrangement of the columns (or rows)
       of the identity matrix. Each row and each column contain exactly one entry of 1, with all other entries being 0.</p>
